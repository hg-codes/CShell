# Description
This is an implementation of the Linux shell in C shell. It supports basic terminal commands and some couple commands. It also uses networking and piping concepts to make the terminal more diverse and robust to commands from the user.

### warp Command
**Syntax:**
```bash
warp [flags] [directory]
```
**Flags:**
- `.`: Current directory
- `..`: Parent directory
- `~`: Home directory
- `-`: Previous directory

**Description:**
Changes the shell's working directory. Supports both absolute and relative paths.

**Examples:**
```bash
warp test          # Changes to /home/user/test
warp ../tutorial   # Changes to /home/user/tutorial
warp ~             # Changes to /home/user
warp -             # Changes to the previous directory
```

---

### peek Command
**Syntax:**
```bash
peek [flags] [path]
```
**Flags:**
- `-a`: Show hidden files
- `-l`: Display extra information

**Description:**
Lists files and directories in the specified directory. Supports flags for additional details and color-coded output.

**Examples:**
```bash
peek test              # Lists files and directories in /home/user/test
peek -a /usr/bin       # Lists hidden files in /usr/bin
peek -l ~              # Displays extra information in /home/user
```

---

### pastevents Command
**Syntax:**
```bash
pastevents
pastevents purge
pastevents execute <index>
```
**Description:**
Stores and retrieves the 15 most recent commands. 'purge' clears stored commands. 'execute' runs a command from the history.

**Examples:**
```bash
pastevents            # Displays the command history
pastevents purge      # Clears the command history
pastevents execute 3  # Executes the command at index 3
```

---

### proclore Command
**Syntax:**
```bash
proclore [pid]
```
**Description:**
Provides information about a process, including PID, status, process group, virtual memory, and executable path.

**Examples:**
```bash
proclore             # Displays information about the shell process
proclore 123         # Displays information about the process with PID 123
```

---

### I/O Redirection
**Syntax:**
```bash
command > output_file
command >> output_file
command < input_file
```
**Description:**
Redirects command output to a file using `>`, appends with `>>`, and takes input from a file using `<`.

**Examples:**
```bash
echo "Hello" > greeting.txt   # Writes "Hello" to greeting.txt
wc < textfile.txt            # Counts words from textfile.txt
```

---

### Pipes
**Syntax:**
```bash
command1 | command2 | command3
```
**Description:**
Passes output from `command1` as input to `command2`, and so on.

**Examples:**
```bash
echo "Lorem Ipsum" | wc | sed 's/ //g'   # Processes output through multiple commands
```

---

### Redirection along with Pipes
**Syntax:**
```bash
command1 | command2 > output_file
command1 < input_file | command2
```
**Description:**
Combines I/O redirection with pipes for more advanced command sequences.

**Examples:**
```bash
cat file.txt | wc > stats.txt   # Counts words in file.txt and writes to stats.txt
```

---

### activities Command
**Syntax:**
```bash
activities
```
**Description:**
Prints a list of all processes spawned by the shell, including command name, PID, and state.

**Examples:**
```bash
activities   # Displays information about currently running processes
```

---

### ping Command
**Syntax:**
```bash
ping <pid> <signal_number>
```
**Description:**
Sends signals to processes based on PID and signal number.

**Examples:**
```bash
ping 123 9    # Sends SIGKILL signal to process with PID 123
ping 456 41   # Sends signal 9 to process with PID 456
```

---

### fg and bg Commands
**Syntax:**
```bash
fg <pid>
bg <pid>
```
**Description:**
`fg` brings a background process to the foreground, and `bg` changes a stopped background process to running.

**Examples:**
```bash
fg 789    # Brings the background process with PID 789 to the foreground
bg 789    # Changes the state of process with PID 789 to running (in the background)
```

---

### neonate Command
**Syntax:**
```bash
neonate -n <time_arg>
```
**Description:**
Prints the Process-ID of the most recently created process every `<time_arg>` seconds until the key 'x' is pressed.

**Examples:**
```bash
neonate -n 4   # Prints the PID every 4 seconds until 'x' is pressed
```

---

### iMan Command
**Syntax:**
```bash
iMan <command_name>
```
**Description:**
Fetches man pages from http://man.he.net/ for the given command.

**Examples:**
```bash
iMan sleep            # Retrieves the man page for the 'sleep' command
iMan invalid_command  # Displays an error for a non-existing command
```
